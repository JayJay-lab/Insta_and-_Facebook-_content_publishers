This repository allows you to post content on your Instagram account without using an app, simply by utilizing Visual Studio Code. 

I used the library **instagrapi** and imported the client from it. Here is the reference documentation for the library: https://subzeroid.github.io/instagrapi/.

I combined object-oriented, functional, and procedural programming paradigms to create an effective code structure.

Please note that the input section for the username and password does not include error handling; therefore, it will crash if you enter incorrect data. Additionally, the network section also lacks error handling, so it will crash if there is no internet connection.
