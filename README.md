This is an instagram content publisher repo 

It allows u to post content on your instagram acc without using an app using only vs code 
I used the library instagrapi and imported client from it here is  the ref doc for the library "https://subzeroid.github.io/instagrapi/"
I used combined OOP,functional and procedural programming paradims for effective code structure 
The input section username and password doesn"t have error handling so it will crush whenever u enter  wrong data
The network section  also doesn't have error handling so i crushes when u don't use internet
